    <ul>
      <li>
        Shape of the array for example my array looked like this: [[0, 0], [0,
        1]] but it could have also looked like this? : [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],
        [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]]
      </li>
      <li>Want to find the quickest way</li>
      <li>Give the location of package to AI?</li>
      <li>Is the size of the map known to the ai? (unknown array size)</li>
      <li>How many ways are there to search an array, names and speed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What inspired this project?</h4>
    <p>
      I wanted to code something that felt it had practicality and to move away
      from the mundane front end tasks Im used to.

    <p>
      In my mind I had an idea on what I'd do and the front end was built
      swiftly until it came time to implement the searching algorithms. I didn't
      want to remind myself so I challenged to come up with it myself.
